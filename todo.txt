Todo:

- Go over the code again and understand wtf is going on ( )
-> Loading not showing. ( )

- Create wireframe + send to ui designer for redesign ( )
-> Pop up ( X )
-> NewTab ( X )
-> On first install ( )

- Test request question based on the type of quiz & difficulty ( X )
-> Have code be as a question and display accordingly ( X )
-> Make it dynamic, if user changes to javascript etc..  ( X )
-> Add more questions for each type & return a random one ( )

- Test request questions based on the seen ids in chrome storage ( X )
-> Create .rpc ( X)
- Add/Remove urls ( X )
-> Double check if works ( X )
-> Exclude these domains from count ( X )
--> Exclude works, but need better way I think ( )
--> If I add google.com it does not work, fixed ( X )
---> but double check again how it works, as it seems to be working now (  )

- Get the favicon of url provided URL and display it ( )



Ideas:
- Make figma design wireframe ( )
- See if the question is correct or not, turn green if is and red if not, allow only clicking once, redirect after ( )
- Store the seen ids in chrome storage and request based on that (  )
- Allower user to choose the type of quiz ( ) 
- Exclude urls ( )
- Exclude urls from the same domain ( )
- After the new tab opens "That also counts as a new tab" , so it should not be counted as a new tab. ( )
- Pause for an hour button or something. ( )
- Questions can repeat on/off button ( )
