Goal 1:
Add url in plugin & display the url in the plugin. ( X )

1.1
Be able to console.log the chrome storage blocked urls ( X )
-> Just click inspect on the pop up bruh

Goal 2:
When that plugin is accessed, have a custom page that has a button "access" ( )


Main idea of the plugin: 

1.
People add a list of websites, once they visit them they need to answer a question to enter it

Choose All domains / Specific domains?

2.
On each new tab open or change of a domain you get a oppertunity to answer a question, but you can just ignore it.

3. Only domain switches (because new tab is basicly a domain switch )
Each time of change of domain or every 3-5 domain switches (user can choose?)

4. 
Select how often you want to be questene ( new tab, domain change, every 10 minutes etc.. )
Then a quizz shows up ( Slider from 1-10 of how often ) a counter that tracks, new tabs opened, how many times domain changes )

Maybe that is too much and too often?

5.
Just a simple add websites & description and when you visit them, you simply click "enter" 
just to double check if your not on autopilot






More specificly:

Settings page:
- Difficulty ( Easy / Hard )
- Dropdown of catagories (Javascript Basics, React Basics, Mascine Learning Basics etc..)
-
