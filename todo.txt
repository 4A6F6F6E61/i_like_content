Todo:

- Make on/off button work & with the slider & other buttons ( )

- Log supabase with .env file or somehow ( )
- When domain changed, show a custom page  ( X )
-> with button "enter" and then they may continue to their page they were going ( X )
-> now with the counter ( X )
- Invert the slider ( )
- Make on/off button work ( )
- Display a question from SUPABASE ( )
-> What type of quizes? ( )

- Allower user to choose the type of quiz ( )?



Some bugs:
- Seems like its storing one url after not before ( really visable with shorts ) 
-> I think I fixed it. ( X )

- After the new tab opens "That also counts as a new tab" , so it should not be counted as a new tab. ( )

- Pause for an hour button or something. ( )

- Make figma design wireframe ( )

Main idea of the plugin: 
- Select how often you want to be question ( Slider from 1-10  )
- Dropdown of catagories (Javascript Basics, React Basics, Mascine Learning Basics etc..)
- Difficulty of questions ( Easy / Hard )
- Questions show up quiz types ( Video, ABCD, etc.., Run actual code in the future )
- Redirect to the site/etc you wanted to see.
